## Features

1. **Real-time Parking Availability**: Pragati uses machine learning algorithms and sensor data to provide real-time updates on available parking spaces.

2. **Dynamic Pricing**: Our system optimizes parking prices based on demand to ensure effective resource usage and generate sustainable revenue.

3. **Parking Reservation and Payment**: Users can conveniently reserve parking spots and make payments through the app, saving time and reducing environmental impact.

4. **Traffic Management**: Pragati analyzes traffic patterns to help city administrators manage congestion and optimize mobility.

5. **Data Analysis**: Pragati collects and analyzes data on parking usage, traffic patterns, and pricing which can be used to make informed decisions and policy planning.

## Tech Stack

- **Machine Learning**: TensorFlow and PyTorch are used for predictive analysis and pattern recognition.
- **Computer Vision**: OpenCV is used for real-time image and video analysis to detect vehicle presence.
- **IoT Sensors**: Energy-efficient sensors are used for real-time data collection on the availability of parking spaces.
- **Backend**: Python and Node.js handle server-side operations, processing sensor data, and running machine learning models.
- **Frontend**: Flutter is used to create an intuitive and responsive user interface.
- **Database**: Firebase is used to store real-time sensor data and user information. It allows for efficient data retrieval and real-time updates.
- **Cloud**: AWS provides scalable computing and storage resources, ensuring the system can handle large amounts of data and high traffic loads.
- **Blockchain**: Blockchain for recording transaction and data, payment processing and NFT/ Token based reward system.


# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### `npm run build` fails to minify
